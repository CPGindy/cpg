            Welcome to fall:&#41; The leaves are not only turning but falling in Indiana. Here&#39;s hoping that all is well in your world.

            Your Q3 Royalty Report is attached for Crown Point Graphics. Both checks and ACH&#39;s have been mailed or submitted. We want to take this time to share a few updates:

            <br/><br />

            <ol type="1">
            <li>We have added Total Royalties Earned &#40;All Artists&#41; to the first page of the report. NOTE: Your ACH/Check will reflect Net Royalties due &#40;which takes into account advances etc.&#41;.</li>
            <li>If Royalties earned are less than $10, we will hold until total due is equal to or greater than $10.</li>
            <li>We have included page breaks by artist. </li>
            <li>We do not have the ability to export excel files out of our new Royalty System. </li>
            <li>The Royalty Report includes sales on all items in the quarter. If an artist is not listed, there were $0 sales in that quarter.</li>
            </ol>  
            If you have questions, please don&#39;t hesitate to reach out. We are happy to help. 

            <br />
            Thank you and we look forward to Q4.

            <br />

            Have a great week!
